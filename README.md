# docstore

Simple and extendable JSON document storage and retrieval

## Installation

    $ npm install docstore

## Usage

```javascript
var ds = require('docstore');

ds.open('./docs/users', function(err, store) {
  assert(err == null);

  store.save({ name: 'Joe', age: 35 }, function(err, doc) {
    assert(err == null);
    console.log(doc._id); // ids are autogenerated and assigned
  });

  // See below for other methods available on store
});
```

## Opening

The first step to using docstore is to open a store. All other
operations are available from the store returned to you via the passed
callback.

### open(directory, options, callback)

__Arguments__

* directory - the directory to read and write documents to/from
* options - an object containing store options (see below)
* callback(err, store) - callback that will be invoked after opening the
  store

__Example__

```javascript
var ds = require('docstore');

ds.open('./docs/users', function(err, store) {
  assert(err == null);
  assert(store != null);
});
```

__options__

The following options are available when opening a store

* format - the format class to use for serializing and deserializing
  objects. It defaults to the JSON formatter in lib/format/json.js

## Saving

When saving, the store uses the configured format implementation to
first serialize the object. If the object has a `_id` property it's
value will be used as the filename. Otherwise, a random filename will be
generated.

### store.save(obj, callback)

__Arguments__

* obj - the object to save
* callback(err, obj) - callback that will be invoked after opening the
  store. It is passed an error if one occurs. If no error occurs it will
  pass the object as saved (with it's generated id).

__Example__

```javascript
store.save({ name: 'Joe', age: 35 }, function(err, doc) {
  assert(err == null);
  console.log(doc._id); // ids are autogenerated and assigned
});
```

## Retrieving

Any document can be retrieved given its id.

### store.get(id, callback)

__Arguments__

* id - the id of the object to get
* callback(err, obj) - callback that will be invoked after retrieving the
  document. It is passed an error if one occurs. If no error occurs it will
  pass the document.

__Example__

```javascript
store.get('id12302202', function(err, doc) {
  assert(err == null);
  assert(doc._id === 'id12302202');
});
```

## Removing

There are two methods for removing documents. You can remove them one at
a time or clear all documents from a store at once.

### store.remove(id, callback)

__Arguments__

* id - the id of the object to remove
* callback(err) - callback that will be invoked after removing the
  document. It is passed an error if one occurs.

__Example__

```javascript
store.remove('id12302202', function(err) {
  assert(err == null);
  console.log('Deleted');
});
```

### store.clear(callback)

__Arguments__

* callback(err) - callback that will be invoked after removing all
  documents. It is passed an error if one occurs.

__Example__

```javascript
store.clear(function(err) {
  assert(err == null);
  console.log('All deleted');
});
```

## Scanning

Scanning is the method used to find particular documents among a large
collection. While there's only one scan method, it can be used in two
ways. You can either get a single callback with all the results as an
array or get them as a stream of document events.

### store.clear(callback)

__Arguments__

* filter - a function to be used to determine if a document should be
  returned from the scan
* callback(err) - optional callback that will be invoked for all
  documents that have passed the filter function. If no callback is
  passed to the scan method, an `EventEmitter` is returned instead. It
  emits `document` events for all documents passing the filter function,
  an `error` event if any errors occur, and an `end` event when scanning
  is finished.

__Examples__

```javascript
var filter = function(doc) {
  return doc._id === 'id12302202';
};

// get all results at once
store.scan(filter, function(err, docs) {
  assert(err == null);
  assert(docs.length === 1);
  assert(docs[0]._id === 'id12302202');
});

// get results as a stream
var stream = store.scan(filter);
stream.on('document', function(doc) {
  assert(doc._id === 'id12302202');
});
stream.on('end', console.log.bind(null, 'Done'));
stream.on('error', console.error.bind(null));
```

## Custom Formats

As mentioned above, the `docstore.open` function accepts an options
object, one option of which is `format`. A format object is used by the
store to serialize an object before writing it to disk and deserializing
it after reading from disk. It's up to you to decide how it should be
represented on disk. A default JSON formatter is used if you don't
specify one. It stores documentas as plain text JSON.

Writing your own custom format is easy, requiring only one property to
be present and two methods to be implemented.

### extension

`extension` is a property used to indicate the file extension to use for
your format. It should include a leading `.`, such as `.json` for JSON
formatted files.

### serialize(obj)

The serialize method is called to format a JavaScript object as it is to
be represented on disk. It must return the serialized form of the
object.

### deserialize(buffer)

The deserialize method is called to format a buffer read from disk back
into its JavaScript object form. It must return a JavaScript object.

__Example Format__

```javascript
exports.extension = '.json';

exports.serialize = function (obj) {
  return JSON.stringify(obj);
};

exports.deserialize = function (buffer) {
  return JSON.parse(buffer);
};
```

## Encryption

`docstore` includes a format object that can be used to encrypt the
files stored on disk. It simply wraps another format object in an
encrypted form. While it's intended to be able to transparently encrypt
any underlying format, it's only been tested with the default JSON
format.

### constructor(algorithm, password, underlyingFormat)

__Arguments__

* algorithm - the encryption algorithm to use. The available algorithms
  is dependent on your version of OpenSSL. On recent releases,
  `openssl list-cipher-algorithms` will display the available cipher
  algorithms.
* password - used to derive id and initialization vector (IV)
* underlyingFormat - the underling format for serializing and
  deserializing JavaScript objects. If no underlying format is given the
  default JSON format implementation will be used.

__Example__

```javascript
var ds = require('docstore');
var Encrypted = require('docstore/lib/format/encrypted');
var encrypted = new Encrypted('aes128', 'password');

ds.open('./docs/users', { format: encrypted }, function(err, store) {
  console.log('You now have an encrypted store');
});
```
